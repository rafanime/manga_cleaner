# üßº PDF Cleaner & Pre-Formatter for Kindle Comic Converter

This repository contains a shell script to **clean and prepare PDFs** (e.g. scanned manga or comics) for conversion to eBook format using [Kindle Comic Converter (KCC)](https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc).

## üìã What It Does

1. Converts the input PDF into high-resolution grayscale **TIFF images**, one per page.
2. **Cleans** each page using ImageMagick:
   - Applies grayscale, blur, and sharpening.
   - Trims whitespace.
   - Resizes to Kindle-friendly dimensions.
3. Stores the cleaned pages in a `cleaned/` folder.
4. This folder is ready to be passed into **Kindle Comic Converter** for final formatting into .mobi or .epub.
